I added the commenting feature on the blog posts using [giscus][giscus]. It basically uses [Github Discussions][discussions-docs] for comments since this website is hosted on [Github Pages][pages-docs] and that only supports static websites, which cannot use normal databases for comments.

You can try it out yourself by signing into your github account and commenting below, or you can comment on the repository's [Github Discussions][discussions] directly.

[giscus]: https://giscus.app
[discussions]: https://github.com/de-soot/de-soot.github.io/discussions
[discussions-docs]: https://docs.github.com/en/discussions
[pages-docs]: https://docs.github.com/en/pages
