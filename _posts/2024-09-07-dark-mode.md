This guide explains why and how to easily make a dark theme for your website using CSS `@media` queries.

Alternative title: System default theme for websites

# Why Dark Mode

For users visiting a website in a dark room at night, it would be less straining for their eyes if the webpage was displayed in a darker colour to match the environment, which is what [dark mode][dark-mode] does.

# How to do it

From [MDN Web Docs][mdn]:
> The @media [CSS][css] [at-rule][at-rule] can be used to apply part of a [style sheet][style-sheet] based on the result of one or more media queries. With it, you specify a media query and a block of CSS to apply to the document if and only if the media query matches the device on which the content is being used.

## For Non-Static-Site-Generator Websites

There is also a [video guide by Eric Murphy on Youtube][yt-vid] if you prefer to follow along with a video.

### External Style Sheet

To separate code between HTML and CSS, link an external CSS style sheet in the `<head>` tag in the HTML document. Like so:

```html
<!-- should resemble something like this -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
...
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
```

And in your `styles.css`:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: #111;
    color: #fdfdfd; /* colour of text */
  }
}
```

### With the \<style> HTML tag

You can also type out your CSS code in between `<style>` tags if you prefer everything to be contained in one HTML document:

```html
<!-- something like this -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
...
<html>
<head>
<style>
    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
        body {
            background-color: #111;
            color: #fdfdfd; /* colour of text */
        }
    }
</style>
</head>
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
```

## For Static Site Generator Websites

It is a little bit less straightforward to do this with static site generators like Jekyll (which is what this website uses) or Hugo, as you have to override the theme's CSS style sheet.

There is a [blog post by Tom Kadwill on how to override your CSS styles in Jekyll][css-blog] you can follow to create your SCSS file, and after which you should get something resembling this:

```css
---
---

@import "minima"; /* replace minima inside the quotes with your Jekyll theme */
```

And you should get something like this after adding the dark mode code.

```css
---
---

@import "minima"; /* replace minima inside the quotes with your Jekyll theme */

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: #111;
    color: #fdfdfd; /* colour of text */
  }
}
```

For other static site generator websites, you can refer to the official documentation found online for information on how to override your theme's style-sheet.

# Configure Giscus Theme

To set `giscus` comments to match the website if you have done the CSS `@media` trick shown above, simply set the `<script>`'s `data-theme` attribute value to `"preferred_color_scheme"` as shown below.

```html
<script src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
        ...
        ...
        ...
        data-theme="preferred_color_scheme"
        ...
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
```
