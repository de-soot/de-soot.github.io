# Why Dark Mode

For users visiting a website in a dark room at night, it would be less straining for their eyes if the webpage was displayed in a darker colour to match the environment, which is what [dark mode][dark-mode] does.

# How to do it

From [MDN Web Docs][mdn]:
> The @media [CSS][css] [at-rule][at-rule] can be used to apply part of a [style sheet][style-sheet] based on the result of one or more media queries. With it, you specify a media query and a block of CSS to apply to the document if and only if the media query matches the device on which the content is being used.

## For Non-Static-Site-Generator Websites

There also exists a [video guide by Eric Murphy on Youtube][yt-vid] if you prefer to follow along with a video.

### External Style Sheet

To separate code between HTML and CSS, link an external CSS style sheet in the `<head>` tag in the HTML document. Like so:

```html
<!-- should resemble something like this -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
...
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
```

And in your `styles.css`:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: #111;
    color: #fdfdfd; /* colour of text */
  }
}
```

### With the \<style> HTML tag

You can also type out your CSS code in between `<style>` tags if you prefer everything to be contained in one HTML document:

```html
<!-- something like this -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
...
<html>
<head>
<style>
    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
        body {
            background-color: #111;
            color: #fdfdfd; /* colour of text */
        }
    }
</style>
</head>
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
```

## For Static-Site-Generator Websites

It is a little bit less straightforward to do this with a static site generator like Jekyll (which has native support with Github Pages and is what this website uses) or Hugo as you have to override the theme's CSS style sheet.

There is a [blog post by Tom Kadwill on how to override your CSS styles in Jekyll][css-blog] you can follow to create your SCSS file and after which you should get something that resembles this:

```css
---
---

@import "minima"; /* replace minima inside the quotes with your Jekyll theme */
```

And you should get something like this after adding the dark mode code.

```css
---
---

@import "minima"; /* replace minima inside the quotes with your Jekyll theme */

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: #111;
    color: #fdfdfd; /* colour of text */
  }
}
```

For other static-site-generator websites, you can refer to the official documentation found online for information on how to override your theme's CSS.

# Configure Giscus Theme

To set `giscus` comments to match the website if you have done the CSS `@media` trick shown above, simply set the `<script>`'s `data-theme` attribute value to `"preferred_color_scheme"` as shown below.

```html
<script src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
        ...
        ...
        ...
        data-theme="preferred_color_scheme"
        ...
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
```

# Why Not Use a Toggleable Button Instead

Rather than defaulting to light or dark mode and having a separate button for the user to manually switch to their preferred theme, it might be better to automatically default to what they already set their browser's preferred theme to.

This is so they do not get flashbanged by their monitors at night if your website defaults to light theme and they open their browser to your website for the first time, if they did not toggle it to dark mode the last time they visited, or if your website does not store cookies about their previously toggled theme.

You can also include the button to toggle themes on the website alongside defaulting it if you want, but I find this an unnecessary use of [Javascript][js].
