i am a student in the **[kaplan singapore][kaplan]** university pursuing their [murdoch bachelor of information technology in artificial intelligence and autonomous systems and computer science degree][degree].

as of right now, i still have yet to finish kaplan's foundation and foundational diploma courses and i need to do that before i can enroll in their bachelor's degree program, so in the meantime i will make some personal projects to practice useful practical skills outside of school and consolidate my knowledge of the material learnt in school.

i will document these projects in the form of short **[blog posts][home]** explaining the projects details. i hope that they can provide some educational value for people like me who are interested in technology (*a.k.a nerds* ðŸ¤“).
