i am a student in the [kaplan singapore][kaplan] university pursuing their [murdoch bachelor of information technology in artificial intelligence and autonomous systems and computer science][murdoch degree].

as of right now, i still have to finish kaplan's foundation and foundational diploma courses before i can enroll in their bachelor's degree program, so in the meantime i will practice practical skills and consolidate my knowledge by making some [personal projects][home] on the side outside of school.

i will document these projects in the form of short [blog posts][home] explaining the projects details. i hope that they can provide some educational value for people like me who are interested in technology.
