i am a  **[kaplan singapore][kaplan]** student pursuing a [Bachelor of Information Technology in Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Systems and Computer Science Double Major from Murdoch University][degree].

my personal projects will be documented in the form of these **[blog posts][home]** on this website. the blogs will explain the projects' details, and i hope that they provide educational value for people interested in technology and AI. ðŸ¤“

i may also occassionally write about my other interests, such as math concepts / formulas i found my teachers did not explain in class (which forced me to come up with explanations myself).
