# my personal website

just a place on the internet where i write blog posts about my projects

## how to visit this website (if it is deployed)

easy, just do either one of these things:
1) just click **[here][link]** or
2) copy this link: **[`https://de-soot.github.io`][link]** and paste it into your browser's address bar and press enter.

[link]: https://de-soot.github.io

## how to run locally

a bit harder, but still relatively simple enough, just:
1) download a copy of the github repository's files onto your computer.
1) follow the guide to install the prerequisites for jekyll: `https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation`
2) once all requirements are installed, run this in your terminal: `gem install jekyll bundler`
3) now that everything's installed and good to go, use `cd` to navigate to the folder where the you downloaded the copy of the github repository and type and enter this into the terminal: `jekyll serve`
4) ...
5) profit!
